                <strong>Day 1 (30-06-25):</strong> Visited Sachivalayam in NTR Nagar to take permission
                for conducting the nutrition survey.<br /><br />

                <strong>Day 2 (01-07-25):</strong> Conducted the survey in different streets of
                NTR Nagar, Nellore district, interacting with community members.<br /><br />

                <strong>Day 3 (02-07-25):</strong> Collected detailed information on daily food habits,
                preferences and nutrition awareness of the people. This helped us realise the importance
                of being grateful for what we have and supporting others as much as possible.<br /><br />

                <strong>Day 4 (03-07-25):</strong> Continued the enquiry on food habits and documented
                the difficulties people are facing in following a proper diet, especially due to
                financial and lifestyle limitations.<br /><br />

                <strong>Day 5 (04-07-25):</strong> Started creating awareness about healthy food habits
                and the need for a proper balanced diet for all age groups.<br /><br />

                <strong>Day 6 (05-07-25):</strong> Visited houses in our neighbourhood to spread awareness
                on balanced diet, explaining simple practical changes families can adopt. We understood
                that enquiry is the first step for any meaningful action.

                <p class="week-text">
                    <strong>Day 1 (07-07-25):</strong> Decided the theme for our awareness speech on
                    <em>food habits and nutrition</em>. Planned how to organise the programme and
                    learnt how to structure a small survey and talk for the community.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 2 (08-07-25):</strong> Conducted an awareness programme on food
                    habits and nutrition. Everyone was encouraged to share their own experiences
                    and feelings, which helped us understand different points of view.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 3 (09-07-25):</strong> Explained to people how to maintain a
                    nutritious diet in simple language using daily examples. This created more
                    awareness about what they are eating every day.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 4 (10-07-25):</strong> Spoke about the importance of a
                    <strong>balanced diet</strong> and why proper food is a basic need for every
                    person, not a luxury.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 5 (11-07-25):</strong> Continued the survey and noted the
                    problems faced by citizens in following healthy food habits. We realised that
                    sharing our knowledge is one of the best ways to truly help people.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 6 (12-07-25):</strong> Visited more houses in the survey area and
                    listened patiently to the feelings and difficulties of each family. We learnt
                    that being patient and listening carefully makes people feel respected and
                    happy.

                    <strong>Day 1 (14-07-25):</strong> Visited houses to calculate the
                    <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> of people using their height and
                    weight. This helped us to share our knowledge about health in a practical
                    way.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 2 (15-07-25):</strong> Continued measuring height and weight of
                    more people. We understood that patience is very important while collecting
                    health information from the community.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 3 (16-07-25):</strong> Calculated the BMI values from the
                    measured heights and weights. We gained experience in organising and
                    re-checking the data we had collected.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 4 (17-07-25):</strong> Gave information to people who were in the
                    early stages of obesity about how to control their weight through proper diet
                    and healthy lifestyle changes.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 5 (18-07-25):</strong> Educated people who were already
                    overweight about how to follow a careful diet and what type of exercises
                    would suit them. This created awareness in the community about the risks of
                    overweight and obesity.

                    <strong>Day 1 (21-07-25):</strong> Visited houses in our area to explain
                    about healthy food habits and a balanced diet. We realised that poverty is
                    still a major reason why many people struggle to follow a proper diet.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 2 (22-07-25):</strong> Conducted another awareness session on how
                    to maintain a healthy diet using locally available and affordable foods. This
                    taught us to be patient and sensitive to each family’s situation.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 3 (23-07-25):</strong> Visited more houses to talk about
                    nutritious food and the importance of regular <strong>exercise</strong>. We
                    learnt that yoga and exercise are some of the best medicines for keeping the
                    body and mind healthy.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 4 (24-07-25):</strong> As part of the survey we distributed some
                    fruits to the people. This small action helped us promote the idea that
                    fruits are simple, tasty and highly nutritious food items that should be part
                    of everyday diet.

                    <strong>Day 1 (28-07-25):</strong> Visited the nearby high school and took
                    permission from the Head Master to conduct our nutrition awareness activities.
                    We interacted with school officials and introduced the theme of our project to
                    them.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 2 (29-07-25):</strong> Conducted an awareness programme on
                    nutrition for the school children, explaining the importance of regular meals,
                    breakfast and healthy snacks.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 3 (30-07-25):</strong> Carried out a small survey among the
                    students about their food habits and problems. We found that many of their
                    health issues were linked to not taking a proper diet.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 4 (31-07-25):</strong> Explained to the students how to maintain a
                    nutritious diet and why both <strong>food and exercise</strong> together are
                    the best medicine for a healthy life.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 5 (01-08-25):</strong> Visited the primary school in our survey
                    area and motivated younger students to follow healthy habits from childhood
                    itself.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 6 (02-08-25):</strong> Continued awareness activities for the
                    school children, talked with them individually and identified their personal
                    problems related to food and health.

                    <strong>Day 1 (04-08-25):</strong> This day was the festival of Bakrid, so we
                    did not conduct the survey. We learnt to be patient and respect community
                    occasions and festivals.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 2 (05-08-25):</strong> Conducted an awareness session for people
                    who are living with <strong>diabetes</strong>. We explained why they should
                    avoid sugary foods and follow regular medical advice.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 3 (06-08-25):</strong> Gave more detailed information about diet
                    control for diabetic people, including the importance of fibre-rich foods and
                    regular monitoring. We understood that working hard for a good cause gives
                    real happiness.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 4 (07-08-25):</strong> Visited the area again to interact with the
                    people and to know their response towards the awareness programmes we had
                    conducted. We felt that even small help and guidance can give a lot of
                    satisfaction.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 5 (08-08-25):</strong> Continued to inform people about healthy
                    food habits and nutrition, stressing that taking precautions regarding health
                    is a “must and should”, not optional.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Day 6 (09-08-25):</strong> Final day of our project. We took
                    photographs of all major activities and completed documentation so that our
                    work and learning can be presented properly in the record and website.
